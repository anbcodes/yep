# Yep - A svg animated interactive video api

Yep allows you to create interactive videos (like [this](https://liqvidjs.org/)) with the same style as [manim](https://manim.community), which is used by the youtuber 3blue1brown. It is based on SVG and we are currently using svelte.

## API
This API is subject to change but currently there is a `Animation` class and a `Rect` class.

# Yep - A svg animated interactive video api

Yep allows you to create interactive videos (like [this](https://liqvidjs.org/)) with the same style as [manim](https://manim.community), which is used by the youtuber 3blue1brown. It is based on SVG and we are currently using svelte.

## API
The code is documented using the tsdoc format. I have yet to figure out how to extract that documentation.

## Developing

Clone the repo then run `npm install` to install the dependencies.

To start the development server, run `npm run dev`

To build the app for production, run `npm run build`
